<p>CossiePlay party-goers party at their own risk and are  responsible for their own safety. Check with your doctor before you party hard.<br>
Party fees must be paid at the door. Cash or EFTPOS  accepted. Credit card payments attract a 2% surcharge. Alcohol is served at the  bar to over 18s only. No intoxicated persons will be served, but will be  escorted to a taxi â€“ paid by the party-goer. </p>

<strong>Login:</strong> jc337718</p>
<h2>Mission</h2>
<p>The CossiePlay website is intended to increase revenue for the bussiness by increasing the number of customers ordering costumes and increase the number of people attending the cosplay parties.</p>
<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
<p>All other advertising and promoting of bussiness, not including the new website, will remain at the same level for 6 months. Once the website has been published, the ammount of costumes ordered and the attendance of the parties will be recorded each month and compared to the previous and following months to see if an increase has been made.</p>
<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p> The desired target audience is high school aged kids to young adults. Both men and women of ages 15-30 will be targeted. </p>
